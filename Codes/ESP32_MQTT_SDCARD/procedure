    OTA Final Working procedure

1:  Normally, both ESP32 and STM will boot normally 
    
    Here the STM will update the ESP32 with Accelerometer data,
    The same data will be published by the ESP32 (via MQTT) on the server.
    
    Data format will be of 32 Bytes (this will be treated as payload for MQTT publishing)

2:  While reading the data from STM32 (via UART), ESP32 will look for a specific
    character 'C' (which means check for update). Upon receiving this abstracted request from
    STM32, ESP32 will request for Update from the Server (over a specific topic).

3:  MQTT Server, will respond to ESP32 with "Authentication Key" which will be sent as it is to the
    STM32,
            (At this moment, ESP32 is just listening to STM32 over the UART)
    
    Case 1: 
      
    In case, STM replies back with '$' then it will be understood as STM32 wants updated firmware
    now, ESP32 will reply with string "ready", in turn STM32 will reply with '$'.

    Case 2: 
      
    In case, STM replies back with data other than '$' then ESP32 will continue working as a publisher of
    Accelarometer Data until '$' is received. (then procedure of Case 1 will be followed)

4:  After receiving the final '$' from STM32, 
                    ESP32 will read 64 bytes of data from SD card, 
                    Saveastart sending the 64 bytes of code length to the 
    STM32 in turn ESP32 will wait for checksum from STM32 (2 bytes character),
