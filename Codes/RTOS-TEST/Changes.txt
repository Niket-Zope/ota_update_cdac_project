Changes on the RTOS APPLICATON:
	1. 	Appended Application Code with '$'
	2. 	Deleted the periodic Check update task - "(void CheckUpdateThread(void *argument))"
	3. 	When user press the button, STM will  check the Signature Structure on the Flash
		for upadteAvailable flag. If it is False STM will send "check_update" to the ESP
		and will wait for the response from ESP.
			ACK  --->	Authorization Frame 
			NACK --->	Anything Else
		If Authentic update is found, STM will update the signature and do the required things
	4. 	If again the button is pressed and updateAvailable of Signature Struture is found to be true
		STM will notify the ESP to download the available update and will jump to the bootloader
			
			

Points to implement/Think:
	1. Should we use Mutex while sending "check_update" to ESP because it may lead to Priority Inversion or deadlock
		(I have analyzed, there should  not be any problem)
	2. Apply proper Debouncing on button
	3. Disable/Enable Interrupts while writing Signature to Flash
	4. Proper Modelling is left (like osDelayUntil())
